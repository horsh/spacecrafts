spacecrafts
===========

This is the family tree of Soviet and post-Soviet spacecraft designs.

The astounding property of Russian space program is the fact that 
successful spacecraft designs, in general, are not abandoned after their 
project is complete, but often used as a basis for something new,
completely different sometimes.

For example, the direct descendants of Yuri Gagarin's very simple
capsule keep flying as late as 2013 in the form of Bion spacecrafts.
The initial designs of moon program not only resulted in the whole
range of Soyuz and Progress spacecrafts, but also in a large variety
of modern Yantar reconnaissance satellites. The very successful Fregat
upper-stage traces its roots to the main engine of 1988 Phobos 1 and 2
martian probes.

The picture should be treated as a mnemonic device, to help you figure
out what is what in the Russian space program.



It does not include the rockets (although it does include some upper
stages).

The first sputniks, manned and inter-planetary programs grow from
the original designs or from the internal  project designations.
The satellites are mostly growing from their production centers and
platforms. Although the boundaries are blurred.

There are different shapes in the picture:

	The production centers are boxes.

	The generic project names and satellite platforms are note shaped.

	The complex orbital stations are double octagons.


Multiple incoming arrows mean "has its ancestors as components or
modules".

To get the complete understanding, it is recommended to
have a table translating the Kosmos numbers to the spacecraft
names.  Such table can be found here, for example:

The picture is all in Russian. Well, Russian is THE space language.

The data is taken from ridiculously public sources such as wikipedia,
novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru or manufactuter websites.

Many thanks to the members of novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru forum for reviews and suggestions.

The latest version of the graphviz source, as well as the pre-built PNG
graph, can be found on  https://github.com/horsh/spacecrafts

I am sure the picture has many errors, the best way to tell me about them
is through github.

Enjoy.
